Scenario A:
(Talk only)For the descriptive simulation of Scenario A, all metrics besides the charging stations average trip are in conformity with our key performance indicators.  

Scenario B:
Decreasing the effective price of an EV vehicle by 5Kâ‚¬ resulted in an increase of 17.1%, or 261 EV's.
These expected growth led to an undesirable average charging station's workload of 83% (>75%), and, also a 261% increase of average waiting time, more than one and a half hour!
By installing an extra charger in each of the charging stations, both of these problems are solved, but it may be too well, might lead to an unefficient use of resources. 

Scenario C:

The shrinkness of the EV's batteries by 40% naturally resulted to a surge of trips to charging stations, but even though it may have increased the waiting times by 25% (8 min) it only led to a small growth in average workload (X%).

One way to address this issues is to increase the charging speed
